# fitbit-data-analysis
Project to analyze data collected from my fitbit devices over the last few years. The data includes weight, heart rate, workouts, and general daily activity

## Steps
1. Downloaded data from the "data export" section of fitbit.com
2. Run the python script "process-raw-files.py" to split the .csv into output csv files for each section
3. Load processed data files into their own mysql tables.

TBD - Data analysis with R/SQL
